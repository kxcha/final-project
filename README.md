# final-project

This project aims to use ultrasonic sensor to create a distance sensing device. When distance between the device and an object is less than 10 inches, the output of ultrasonic sensor triggers the micro servo to vibrate. This project uses https://makecode.microbit.org/. The goal of the project is to let people with normal vision experience what it is like for visually impaired individuals to navigate in a world where accessible infrastructures are lacking. The goal is to help develop empathy among designers, researchers, engineers and anyone whose work will have an impact in the world we live in. By interacting with the final deliverable, the emotional experience evoked by uncertainties and challenges would create conversations that counts on the visually impaired individuals’ struggles and the stigma they face in the process of innovating. Anyone can become visually restricted at different level for however long it may last. It could be a result of aging, disease or restricted conditions in the environment. By recreating a vulnerable experience without users’ anticipation, the project wants to deliver the message that innovation should take a diverse user group into account because users needs and capabilities could suddenly change.

## Getting Started

This project uses https://makecode.microbit.org/ to test and run the code.

### Prerequisites

To asemble the device, you will need the following materials: 1 x BBC micro:bit; 1 x Ks0360 Keyestudio Sensor Shield V2 for BBC micro:bit; 1 x HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor; 1 x 9G SG90 Mini Micro Servo; 1 x 9V battery; 4 x female/female jumper cables

### Installing

See here for instruction to put the code in makecode together: 

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
